Adds additional terrain elements, weather, and biomes. It also updates the map in response to weather, giving a more wild, untamed and alive feeling to each map.

Requires a new save. Some of the weather effects might cause a little bit of lag (at high speeds or if you’re really zoomed out) but you can turn them off in the options.

Most new elements will generate in the standard biomes, but there are some biomes that guarantee new features, and a few elements are ONLY available in some biomes. Most of the elements were directly inspired by places I’ve camped in the US.

There are also new resources, items, dangers, natural protection from raids and other effects. Resources can be harvested to get items, which can be sold or consumed.
